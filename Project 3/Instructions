This assignment has two parts:  The first part is  - Forming multiple hypotheses about imdb data set. The second part is testing three of these hypotheses specified in part B.

PART A

The Movies data set which can be found in Files/Datasets 

contains  imdb scores of 12,800+ movies  along with several attributes including budget, gross  genre, content rating etc.

What are the most promising  alternative hypotheses  about imdb scores to test?  Name your three top candidates along with the evidence which backs them up:  either in the form of R instruction(s)  or plot.

Submit code + ppt.

For example "High Budget R movies have lower imdb scores."

"Dramas rated R have higher imdb scores"

This is synthetic data set based on real data set from Kaggle. I have embedded my own patterns in the data to make it a data puzzle. May be you can find out what I did?

PART B

Pick three alternative hypotheses (and corresponding NULL hypotheses), call them A, B, C such:

1) for A, p-value is small (but not zero!), say 0.001? 

2) For B, p-value is close to (but smaller) than critical value, say 0.03

3) For C, p-value is larger than critical value of 0.05, say 0.15  (that is you fail to reject null hypothesis)

NOTE:  These three hypotheses obviously have nothing to do with each other. For example A  can be "R-rated action movies have higher average imdb score than PG-rated comedies"  (what will be NULL hypothesis?), B can be "High Budget Comedies have higher average imdb score than Low Budget Comedies" and C can be High Gross movies have lower  average imdb score than Medium Gross movies

Use any hypothesis test (permutation test, z-test)  from the active textbook, section 9.  Of course run it on your R studio with the Movies data set from HW4.

Clearly state both alternative and NULL hypothesis in each of these three cases - A, B and C.
